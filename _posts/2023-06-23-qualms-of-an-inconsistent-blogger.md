I must confess something... something that has been on my mind for a while. I just want to put it out. I started blogging way back when I was in college. I used to share stuff on Facebook before that. Once in a while I'd find something amusing, usually Physics related. I'd get excited and then have this intense urge to share it with others. But Facebook was no proper channel to share and organize my thoughts. So, I thought I'd start blogging.

My first post was a poem, perhaps... if I were to recall correctly. I originally  wrote it when I was in high school. To be honest, it wasn't that good but I shared it anyway. Some Haiku-like mini poems, of two lines each, followed quickly. Then a thing or two on Physics. Like, a beautiful video on murmurations (flocks of starlings) and another on the Chladni figures (patterns on sand sprinkled atop a vibrating plate).

And, yes, how could I forget those failed attempts at writing fiction? I can recall an intro to a short story, where an artist ("Solitary Man") left everything behind for his passion: "I chose the woods, wholeheartedly embracing the wilderness. Tranquility. Calmness. The place seemed perfect. No one to disturb you. No one to distract you. Noâ€”nothing." And that "Letter from Tachyon" written by the brother of Light in search of a friend.

After that, I stopped abruptly. I don't know why. Maybe I was bored. Maybe I became lazy... Then after a hiatus of a year or so, I started again. This time, too, I didn't post much, other than some very crude sketches in ink. There was this series of articles I had planned out but couldn't complete. It was about the fascinating world of Polymer Physics, inspired by the wonderful graduate text of Plischke & Bergensen [^footnote] on statistical mechanics.

Now after a long, long time I reappear in front of you filled with remorse. I admit that I have been inconsistent this whole time. I should have blogged regularly, even if it was for once in a week or two. I'd die to change all that if I could ever turn back time. But I could never be able do that. Could I? With this confession, I'm starting out again. I wish to start afresh and do it right once and for all. I want to ditch the tag of an "inconsistent blogger".

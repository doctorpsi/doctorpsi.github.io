How do you do, fellow readers? I'm a budding theoretical physicist who is keen on exploring a variety of things. When I'm not studying Physics, I'm either coding or just plain old daydreaming. 

I am a simpleton with a not so impossible dream â€” i.e., to guide and inspire lost souls, like me, through my writings. If this blog strikes you and ignites even a sliver of hope and inspiration, I can run to the Himalayas and die in peace. Or maybe do something even better. Who knows?
